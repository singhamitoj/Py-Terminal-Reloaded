# Py-Terminal Reloaded
This is a follow up to the original Py-Terminal I made a year ago. The old one was pretty bad, but this one is MUCH better. (If you want to see how far I've come, check the old one; It's still there today.)
# How does it work?
You are first greeted with a login screen. You can login with an existing account, but you can also create a new one if you want to (via Create-Account.py). Multiple accounts are now supported. After you log in, a terminal prompt shows up. This isn't really a terminal; It just looks like one. However, you CAN input commands. I'm still working on it, so there are only a few commands. You can find the commands list in commands.txt or type "help" in the shell.
