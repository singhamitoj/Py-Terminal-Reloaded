# SQL-Multiplication-Tester
This is a simple Python 3 application that test your multiplication skills.
# How does it work?
It uses an account system that I made in SQL. It loads the accounts from the database, but only one account can be used as of now, and it is a little buggy.
You can choose the range for the multiplication. For example, you can choose a range of 20 x 20. The program will only give problems that are in this range.
